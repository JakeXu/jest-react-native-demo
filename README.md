# Demo Jest React Native Project
This was my attempt to get React Native working with Jest by using the `react-native-mock` package available from [lelandrichardson/react-native-mock](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-native-mock)

While this does not work, this shows how I was able to get the mocking working by displaying that both Text and View are being mocked. The error comes in when attempting to use enzyme to shallow render the elements.
